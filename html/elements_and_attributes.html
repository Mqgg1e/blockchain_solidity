    <p>h and p have contents, while some elements don't have contents (empty elements) 
        and they needn't end tag.</p>

    <p>This is a table that shows the most used empty elements.</p>
    <table border="1">

    <p>All HTML elements can have attributes. 
        Attributes provide additional information about elements.
        Attributes are always specified in the start tag</p>
    <p>The &lt;a&gt; tag defines a hyperlink. 
        The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to</p>
    <p>The &lt;img&gt; tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.
        The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed</p>
    <p>The &lt;img&gt; tag should also contain the width and height attributes,
         which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels)</p>
    <p>The required alt attribute for the &lt;img&gt; tag specifies an 
        alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot
         be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error 
         in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.</p>
    <img src="img_typo.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
    <p>The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.</p>
    <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
    <p>You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. 
        This is meant to assist search engines and browsers. &lt;html lang="en"&gt;</p>
    <p>Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute.
        &lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;</p>
    <p>The title attribute defines some extra information about an element. 
        The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip 
        when you mouse over the element.</p>
    <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
